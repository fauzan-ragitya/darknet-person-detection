# darknet-person-detection

Code to do a real time person detection on thermal camera. It uses to servos with two digit of freedom so it will be able to adjust the camera position so that the target is 
tracked continuously. I use NVIDIA Jetson Nano as the processing device, FLIR Lepton 3.5 thermal imaging camera, and two MG995 servos. I use YOLOv4 tiny algorithm in the darknet framework
